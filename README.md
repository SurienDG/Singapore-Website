## View website [here](https://SurienDG.github.io/Singapore-Website/Gallery.html)

## Current state:

- This website was made as a project for a web design course to explore various css, HTML, and Javascript techniques
- Website works best at a view port of **1280 x 1024** (wasn't made to be responsive)

## Future goals:
- Make responsive
- Add server side code to process form data instead of going to email
